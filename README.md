# COVID-19-Data-Pipeline

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline that automates the extraction, transformation, loading, and visualization of COVID-19 data. The pipeline fetches data from a public API, stores it in a SQL database, and creates a simple visualization of key metrics over time.

Objectives:
Extract COVID-19 case data from a public API
Clean and transform the data for analysis
Load the data into a SQLite database for easy access
Visualize key metrics (e.g., confirmed cases over time) using Plotly

Tools & Technologies:
Python (requests, pandas, sqlite3, plotly)
SQLite (for lightweight, local database)
COVID-19 API (https://covid19api.com/)
Plotly (for interactive visualizations)
